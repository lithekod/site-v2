## Details

Due to Covid-19 the contest will look a bit different than usual. Teams will be
able to compete from home if they so wish, and due to this there is a limit of
one computer per team member rather than the usual one computer per team.

<del>For those interested and willing, LiTHe kod will offer access to university
computer labs and free food on the day of the contest. Due to the new rules
above, however, this is not a requirement for participating. For those competing
on-site we will begin at 10:00 in Ada Lovelace, door 27 in B-huset, with
information about the contest rules and a few words from our sponsors.</del>

We will begin at 10:00 in [our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/UG5YYsN) with
a streamed intro presentation.

We will also have a warm up one week before the contest (October 31) in our
Discord server, starting at around 11:00. Come and ask
questions about competitive programming in general or NCPC specifically. There
won't be any planned happenings, so if you're wondering how competitive
programming actually works, this is a good place to ask.

Registrations will be handled through the link at the top for teams with up
to three people. If you don't have a team to compete with and don't want to
compete by yourself (or if you are two people looking for a third), send an e-mail
to <a href="mailto:vordf@lithekod.se">vordf@lithekod.se</a> with "ncpc
registration" somewhere in the subject line, at or before November 1. Please include if you are ICPC
eligible (see below) <del>and if you want to compete on-site or not. Due to the
current situation, a wish to compete off-site will take priority</del>.

Note that progress to NWERC can only be offered to teams that are
[ICPC eligible](https://icpc.global/regionals/rules), that is, if your
participants:

* Have not participated in NCPC or equivalent five different years
* Have not participated in ICPC two different years
* Were born in 1997 or later
* Began studying at a university or a comparable institution in 2016 or later
