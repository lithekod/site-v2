## Details

LiTHe kod will provide access to computer labs, free lunch and baloons for
solved problems during the competition. But because the rules above it is not a
must for participating. For those on campus the day starts 10:00am in Ada
Lovelace, entrance 27 in the B-house, with information about the rules and some
words from our sponsors. Contestants contesting from home will have a stream in
our Discord server.

There will also be a warmup one week before the competition (October 2nd) with
start ~11:00am. The warmup competition will be on Kattis for anyone who wants
to test out the system. Come and ask questions about competetive programming or
NCPC! There is not specific schedule, so if you wonder about how competetive
programming actually works, this is the time to ask. (You can of course ask us
on regular meetups as well.)
