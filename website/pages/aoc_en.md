# Advent of Code

Join our [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard)! The join code
is <b style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.3em;">637041-f5ee40da</b>.

Every december something amazing happens. Programmers voluntarily wake up at
6.00am and solve small cozy problems in Advent of Code. Christmas is about
giving gifts, that is why LiTHe kod is donating 20 SEK for every solved
problem. 10 SEK to COVID-19 research and 10 SEK to Advent of Code itself. There
will of course be a Advent of Code kickoff at the meetup the first of december!
See you there!

The leaderboard below is sorted a bit different from the one at the Advent of
Code site. This is our official sorting which prioritizes stars first and
points second.

More information about prizes coming soon!
