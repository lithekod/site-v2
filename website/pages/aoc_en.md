LiTHe kod will be hosting the yearly [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
competition from the 1st of December until its end on the 25th. Advent of Code
is a competition in which programming problems are solved each day until
Christmas Day.

If all problems of the day are solved, two silver stars (one gold star)
are awarded. LiTHe kod will donate one tree for every two silver stars to
[teamtrees.org](https://www.teamtrees.org) for charity. One tree is equivalent
to about 10 SEK and LiTHe kod will donate up to 15,000 SEK depending on how
many problems have been solved at the end of the competition.

The 10 best competitors will win gift cards with matching sums:

<ol start="0">
<li> 1500 kr </li>
<li> 1000 kr </li>
<li> 750 kr </li>
<li> 500 kr </li>
<li> 500 kr </li>

<li> 200 kr </li>
<li> 200 kr </li>
<li> 200 kr </li>
<li> 200 kr </li>
</ol>

Winners are chosen primarily based on the amount of problems solved and
secondly on the points awarded by Advent of Code.

The competing is free and there will be a startup event on the 3rd of December
in Caf√© Java at 5:15 pm.
