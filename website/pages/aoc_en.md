<div id="important-information">
    <p> Hello, this year's advent of code is now over! </p>

<p>
    We have raised 6380:- in total for covid-research and 6380:- to
    the creator of Advent of Code!
</p>

<p>
    Moreover, there are ten programmers that have won prizes! To claim your
    prize, send an email to kassor@lithekod.se from your liu-mail containing a
    screenshot of the settings tab found on the Advent of Code website. It is
    important that you are logged into your account on this screenshot so we
    can verify your identity.
</p>

<p>
    The prizes are handed out as digital giftcards that can be
    purchased and distributed online. Include, because of that, also what
    website you want your giftcard to in the email.
    Congratulations to everyone who won!

Join our [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard)! The join code

Every december something amazing happens. Programmers voluntarily wake up at
6.00am and solve small cozy problems in Advent of Code. Christmas is about
giving gifts, that is why LiTHe kod is donating 20 sek for every solved
problem. 10 sek to COVID-19 research and 10 sek to Advent of Code itself. There
will of course be a kickoff for Advent of Code at the meetup the first of
December! See you there!

In addition to our Advent of Code leaderboard, we also arrange our own
competition. We use a sorting that's a little different to the one on Advent of
Code's site where we primarily sort by number of stars and secondarily by the
number of points. Only people studying at LiU are eligible to compete but you
can press a super advanced button below to also show non-competitors. If you
think that you should be on the competition list but aren't, please contact
someone on the board and we'll take a look at it. (You can also contact us if
you don't want to be on the competition list.)

Prizes are dealt out according to the following when the competition ends
2020-12-25 23.59.

<li>1500 SEK</li>
