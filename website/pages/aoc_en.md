        (2020-12-01) Due to unforseen consequences we were forced to reset the leaderboard
        today. If you are no longer in the leaderboard, you need to join it
        again.

        (2020-12-04) We've also added information about non-competitors below.

# Advent of Code

Join our [leaderboard](https://adventofcode.com/2020/leaderboard)! The join code
is <b style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 1.3em;">637041-f5ee40da</b>.

Every december something amazing happens. Programmers voluntarily wake up at
6.00am and solve small cozy problems in Advent of Code. Christmas is about
giving gifts, that is why LiTHe kod is donating 20 sek for every solved
problem. 10 sek to COVID-19 research and 10 sek to Advent of Code itself. There
will of course be a kickoff for Advent of Code at the meetup the first of
December! See you there!

In addition to our Advent of Code leaderboard, we also arrange our own
competition. We use a sorting that's a little different to the one on Advent of
Code's site where we primarily sort by number of stars and secondarily by the
number of points. Only people studying at LiU are eligible to compete but you
can press a super advanced button below to also show non-competitors. If you
think that you should be on the competition list but aren't, please contact
someone in the board and we'll take a look at it. (You can also contact us if
you don't want to be on the competition list.)

Prizes are dealt out according to the following after the competition has ended:

<ol start="0">
<li>1500 SEK</li>
<li>1100 SEK</li>
<li>750 SEK </li>
<li>500 SEK </li>
<li>500 SEK </li>
