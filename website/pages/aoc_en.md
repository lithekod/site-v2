Every december something amazing happens. Programmers voluntarily wake up at
6.00am and solve small cozy problems in Advent of Code. Christmas is about
giving gifts, that is why LiTHe kod is donating 20 sek for every solved
problem. 10 sek to COVID-19 research and 10 sek to Advent of Code itself. There
will of course be a kickoff for Advent of Code at the meetup the first of
December! See you there!

The leaderboard below is sorted a bit different from the one at the Advent of
Code site. This is our official sorting which prioritizes stars first and
points second.

Prizes are dealt out according to the following after the competition has
ended: First place 1500 sek, second place 1100 sek, third place 750 sek, 4:th to and including 6:th place 500 sek, 7:th to and including 10:th place 250 sek.
