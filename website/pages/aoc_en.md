        Hello, this year's advent of code is now over. We have raised 9450:- in
        total for covid-solidarity-fund and 9450:- to the creator of advent of
        code! More over, there are fifteen programmers that have won prizes! To
        get your prize if you are one of the winners (you know that you are one
        of the winners of you are on any of the places 0-14) you have to send
        an email to kassor@lithekod.se from your liu-mail containing an
        screenshot of the settings-tab found on the advent of code website. It
        is important that you are logged into your account on this screenshot
        so we can verify your identity. The prizes are handed out as digital
        giftcards that can be purchased and distributed online. Include,
        because of that, also what website you want your giftcard to to the

Every december something amazing happens. Programmers voluntarily wake up at
6.00am and solve small cozy problems in Advent of Code. Christmas is about
giving gifts, that is why LiTHe kod is donating 20 sek for every solved problem.
10 SEK to WHO's COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund and 10 SEK to Advent of Code
itself. There will also be a small kick-off on the meetup on November 30th. See
you there!

How to join our leaderboard and competition:

1. Create a user on
   [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/2021/auth/login). If you log in
   with a Github account you can even showcase your nice solutions.
2. Join our leaderboard by entering the code <b style="font-family: monospace;
   font-size: 1.3em;">272152-8e06bd96</b> on [the leaderboard
   page](https://adventofcode.com/2021/leaderboard/private). Note that we have
   a new code this year so we can see who has joined the contest.

Advent of Code is a global advent calendar created by Eric Wastl. The problems
start quite easy and get more and more difficult the closer they get to
Christmas. We at LiTHe kod have created a private leaderboard which unlike the
global leaderboard only contains students at LiU and other friends of LiTHe kod.
(The global leaderboard is practically filled to the brim with professional
competitive programmers.)

In addition to our Advent of Code leaderboard, we also arrange our own
competition. We use a sorting that's a little different to the one on Advent of
Code's site where we primarily sort by number of stars and secondarily by the
number of points. Only people studying at LiU are eligible to compete but you
can press a super advanced button below to also show non-competitors. If you
think that you should be on the competition list but aren't, please contact
someone on the board and we'll take a look at it. (You can also contact us if
you don't want to be on the competition list.)

Prizes are dealt out according to the following when the competition ends at
2021-12-25 23.59.
