# What is a game jam?

A game jam is an event where programmers, artists and gamers come together to
create games; both computer games and board games. At our game jam there is a
48 hours time limit and a randomized theme for inspiration.

# FAQ

### Am I welcome?

All are welcome, student and non-student alike. No previous experience is
needed and the event is free of charge.

### Where are your events held?

Due to COVID-19 events are held remotely via [LiU Game Jam's Discord
server](https://discord.gg/tP2kDvgQKn). We hope to return to physical jams once
that is over.

### How are groups selected? Do I need a team?

Groups will be randomized for brainstorming purposes, but you are free to work
with whomever you like. The starting groups will allow you to find people
sharing similar ideas. We make sure everyone finds someone to work with.

### Do I need to be able to program?

Not at all! Game design covers all kind of fields such as art, music, design,
storywriting, level creation and problemsolving. Anyone who is eager to create
is welcome.
