### Themes

The themes are generated at the start of the jam by taking random pairs of words submitted by participants.

Theme word rules:

- Should only be one English word.
- Should not be a game genre (e.g. FPS, RTS).
- Keep it safe for work. 

Our theme process ensures unique and challenging themes each jam. The themes are there for inspiration during brainstorming but you can pick something else as well.

# FAQ

### Am I welcome?

All are welcome, student and non-student alike. No previous experience is
needed and the event is free of charge.

### Can I join the jam remotely?

Not completely as we want to keep this game jam on site. You are free to work remotely but introduction, review and play testing events will be on site. Make sure you can visit for them or have a team member there to represent you.

### How are groups selected? Do I need a team?

Groups will be randomized for brainstorming purposes, but you are free to work
with whomever you like. The starting groups will allow you to find people
sharing similar ideas. We make sure everyone finds someone to work with.

### Do I need to have a team to participate?

You can work alone or in teams. It is more fun to jam in teams so we highly encourage you to find one.

### Do I need to follow the theme?

The theme is there for inspiration during brainstorming. If you have your own idea or an already existing project feel free to work on it.

### Do I need to be able to program?

Not at all! Game design covers all kind of fields such as art, music, design,
storywriting, level creation and problemsolving. Anyone who is eager to create
is welcome.

### What can I make my game in?

Anything, a lot of jammers favor using game engines for the ease of use but participants have used everything from custom made programming languages to Google spreadsheets. A good list of resources can be found [here](/gamejam/tools/en).

### Can I use assets packs or reuse code?

Yes, feel free to use anything you have to make a kickass game.
