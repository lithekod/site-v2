# Lödöl 2022

This year we're tyring again wth the lödöl ("solder-beer"). As the name implies
we will solder and drink beer. We're going to solder small sensors to a circuit
board and write code that does something fun. Beer or an alternative beverage
will be served alongside.

The Lödöl is held in collaboration with MindRoad who will supply both hardware
and know-how on site. They will also be avaiable for questions about sommarjobb
and other opportunities.
