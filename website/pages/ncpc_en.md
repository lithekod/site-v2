# NCPC

NCPD (Nordic Collegiate Programming Contest) is a yearly contest in competetive
programmering where students from universities in the Nordic (nowadays also
Estonia and Lithuania) participate. NCPC usually takes place sometime during the autumn term.

## NCPC 2021

Our hope is that NCPC 2021 can take place on-site at the campus, but we haven't
heard anything about this from the national organizers yet. In the worst case
the competition will be held remotely, like last year.
