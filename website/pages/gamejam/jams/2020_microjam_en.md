# Microjam

A microjam is an event where **anyone** can create a game in just 5 hours. A
[gamejam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam), but smaller!

The jam is first come first served, where the first 40 who fill out
[this form](https://forms.gle/AGL46AXUGzfYgEbG7) get to participate. This
is due to recommendations from Folkh√§lsomyndigheten. All participants will get
free pizza.

We offer a code skeleton written in Python using the library pygame. The
code skeleton is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lithekod/snake-ribs).
Or, if you prefer, as a [zip file](https://github.com/lithekod/snake-ribs/archive/master.zip).
Documentation can be found [here](/snake-ribs/)

The jam will be held Saturday October 3rd 2020 from 3pm to 8pm in the rooms U3,
U4, U6 and U7 in the C-house at campus Valla.
